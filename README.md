# Bakeology
I made this website for my school digital assessment, I am going to use this space to explain a bit about it.

I used flex-box for just about everything and I only used one main stylesheet, which now has over 500 lines of code on it! That is mainly due to the fact that I used flex-box where I probably should have used "grid" instead and have ended up with a ridiculous amount of CSS classes. I added a favicon after watching a youtube tutorial on how to do it, because W3 Schools didn't give the best description of how to do it. I also removed the scroll bar on the side of the screen so that it all looked a bit nicer.

I am pretty proud of my nav bar. I made the logo in the top left corner the home button. To make the logo fit my color scheme I had to throw it into photopea and change all the colours around to match. I had to crop quite a few images in photopea along the way.

The index page features a bunch of stuff including the huge hero image. I don't really have much to say about the home page, except that it was the first page I coded and I featured a few things from the other pages like the products. also a few of the "h2" titles are actually links to there corresponding pages e.g. the "Our Products" sub-heading is also a link to the products page. 

The about page features a slideshow which I did copy and paste from W3 Schools, but I then edited the style of it to match my theme and removed the captions, I hope that my being able to do that shows that I have some understanding of how it works. I also put comments to label where I copy and pasted. 

The product page does not feature all the products that were in the "text for website task" document, the reason being I couldn't be bothered adding them all in. It would have just been a ton of copy and paste, and reusing the classes I had already used for the 4 products I did add. I also felt that you get the jist of it from seeing how the first 4 products were displayed anyway.

The contact page features a "sign up" popup where you can enter your email address. The only reason I added the made up newsletter section was so I had an excuse to add another, more advanced feature to the website. Again I copy and pasted the code from W3 Schools and then edited it to my liking. I couldn't figure out how to set a href for the submit button so now it just takes you to an error 404 page. If I could set a href I probably would have linked it to the index page like I did with the Social Media links.

Funny thing! when I was looking up images of bread shops I thought I'd add "bakeology" to the search to see if there were any actual bread stores called bakeology. Turns out there are quite a few. One of them that was based in Dubai used the same "alex-brush" font in their logo that I did on my website. Another one is based in Dublin where my family and I are going to visit next week, so I might be able to visit it irl. I used pictures of it in the "about" page.

To wrap up, I'm pretty happy with it, it's definitely the best website I have made so far. Next time I would make sure to use CSS grids when appropriate instead of using flex-box for everything, because it just made everthing super over-complicated.
