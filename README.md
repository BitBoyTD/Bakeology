I made this website for my school digital assessment, I am going to use this space to explain a bit about it.

I used flex-box for just about everything and I only used one main stylesheet, which now has over 500 lines of code on it! That is mainly due to the fact that I used flex-box where I probably should have used "grid" instead and have ended up with a ridiculous amount of CSS classes.
